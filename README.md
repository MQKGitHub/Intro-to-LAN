## 🛡️ Intro to LAN

**Room:** [Intro to LAN — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtolan)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(17 April 2025)* 

### 🎯 Objective
This room introduced basic networking concepts with a focus on LAN topologies, subnetting, and how data moves between devices on a network. The goal was to understand how different network setups work and how data is routed or switched across them.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts
- **Star Topology** – Devices connect through a central switch or hub; reliable but costly.
- **Bus Topology** – All devices share one cable; cheap but prone to slowdowns and failure.
- **Ring Topology** – Devices form a loop; simple cabling but one break can bring it all down.
- **Switches** – Smart devices that send data only to the right target, reducing traffic.
- **Routers** – Connect different networks and send data between them.
- **Subnetting** – Splitting one big network into smaller ones for control, security, and efficiency.
- **ARP** – Helps devices link IP addresses with MAC addresses for communication.
- **DHCP** – Automatically gives IP addresses to devices when they join the network.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- TryHackMe Virtual Machine and built-in tools (Linux terminal, browser, interactive diagrams)

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Subnetting was a bit tricky at first — especially understanding the subnet mask and how it relates to IP addresses.
- It helped to think of subnetting like slicing a cake and dividing it between friends — made it easier to picture.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How different topologies affect performance and reliability.
- The role of switches and routers in a network.
- Subnetting helps divide a network into smaller parts for better control and security.
- ARP links MAC and IP addresses so devices know how to talk to each other.
- DHCP makes it easy for devices to get IP addresses without manual setup.

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Understanding switches and routers is key for setting up secure and efficient networks. Subnetting is often used in businesses to separate staff and public devices (like in a café), improving security and management.

### 💭 Reflections:
- I really liked how interactive and visual the explanations were — especially for things like ARP and DHCP.
- Star topology made the most sense to me, even though it needs more investment.
- Next time, I’d spend a bit more time with subnetting examples to get more confident.
- The cake analogy for subnetting was a great mental trick — I won’t forget that.
